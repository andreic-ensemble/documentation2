# Importing Changes from an LDIF File

Entries can be added, modified, and deleted based on changes described in an LDIF formatted file using the ldif-utils utility located at <RLI_HOME>/bin/advanced. The command syntax to import an LDIF file is shown below.

`ldif-utils ImportLdifChanges -f <ldif_file_path> -d <datasource_name>  [-g true/false (continueOnError;default=true)]`

An example of the syntax used inside the LDIF file is shown below.
